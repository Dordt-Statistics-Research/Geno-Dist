	4 models for each of the 16 representative example varieties
	where each model was selected as the best model out of 20
	iterations of the normalmixEM.

	4 models for variety 8006 run 16 different times where each
	time the modeling process was done, the normalmixEM algorithm
	was run 20 times and the best result was chosen.

samples8.pdf
	4 models for variety 8006 run 16 different times where each
	time the modeling process was done, the normalmixEM algorithm
	was run 1 time and the best result was chosen. Because the
	normalmixEM algorithm has an element of randomness to it, it
	is common to see different results for each of the 16
	different runs. This is why samples9.pdf shows much more
	stable results.
